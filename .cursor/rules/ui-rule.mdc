Always maintain an ultra-clean, minimalistic, premium design aesthetic.

Use generous spacing, perfect alignment, and consistent layout rhythm.

Typography must be precise, elegant, readable, and consistent with the landing page.

Use the same pink + warm gold accent theme across all screens.

All components must feel soft, refined, and intentional — no clutter, no noise.

Use subtle, smooth, non-distracting micro-interactions (hover lift, soft shadows, gentle reveals).

Animations must be elegant and premium — Apple-level polish, not flashy.

Every UI element must look balanced, calm, and government-grade professional.

Keep all visuals cohesive with the landing page's design vocabulary (colors, shadows, borders, spacing).

Ensure pixel-perfect responsiveness and high accessibility (contrast, focus states, keyboard support).

Avoid over-decoration — simplicity and clarity are the highest priorities.

No errors, no broken layouts — code should be clean, maintainable, and consistent.

Every new screen must visually feel like part of the same family as the landing page.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion and ensure animations have graceful fallbacks.

All UI must feel premium, calm, trustworthy, and easy for citizens to use.
